# SJPL Catalog Search!

There are 2 catalogs!  How pleasant!
Old
http://catalog.sjlibrary.org/search~/a?searchtype=X&searcharg=limits+to+growth&SORT=D&searchscope=1

New!
http://discover.sjlibrary.org/iii/encore_sjpl/search/C__Slimits%20to%20growth__Orightresult__U1?lang=eng&suite=sjpl

the search string is url-encoded in between the C__S and __0
I hope those are constant...

How friendly!  So it looks like there is a table with class "browseResult" for each item.

There are spans with classes for type and year:
class=itemMediaDescription
class=itemMediaYear

There may be a class itemBoomCover which may contain an image with class browseThumbnail, which is the book cover!

For the title itself, there should be an a within a div with class dpBibTitle
with id=recordDisplayLink2Component_XXX, where XXX is an index that marches up.

The trimmed text of this should be an decent title.

For author, check in a div with class dpBibAuthor with id authorDisplayLinkComponent_1

# Amazon Product Pages!
I don't think one can search by ISBN #

Amazon product page URL, need to curl this and find a reliable book title

Prettier product page!
